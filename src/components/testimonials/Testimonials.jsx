I have found him very polite and respectful, also very smart and skilled. He is always ready to help teammates and juniors, and he is good at mentorship and leadership. I give Chia Carlyle my highest recommendation for the position that he is applying for."

    review: "Chia is an amazing friend and a very smart software developer. He is usually very willing to offer help to any team member who faced any technical blockers and when he himself faced them he would always reach out for help to avoid time wastage. Chia always challenges himself to tackle tough challenges which is something that I noticed about him. He is the perfect team player who has project leader abilities but gives other people that chance so that they too can learn that invaluable soft skill. I highly recommend Chia and I would like to work with him again."

    review: "Chia Carlyle is the kind of software developer any company would love. I built with him several Single Page Applications (SPA) using JavaScript, and React-Redux within several consecutive weeks. Anytime I got struggling with a tough data structures problem, within a few hours, He'd managed to explain a concept I'd been struggling with for days. He has a great way of simplifying complex problems into bite-sized pieces, and as a junior developer, that was really valuable for me. He's also just a fun person to chat with! If you need to get a job done simply and efficiently, Chia Carlyle is the right person for you."
